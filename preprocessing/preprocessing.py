'''
The medfilt function, short for "median filter," is a method used in signal processing to reduce noise in a signal. It replaces each data point with the median value in its neighboring window. This helps smooth out the signal while preserving sharp edges and important features.

Here's how medfilt works:

Windowing: It slides a window of a specified size (kernel) along the signal.
Sorting and Median Calculation: For each position of the window, it sorts the data points within the window and selects the middle value, which is the median.
Replacement: It replaces the value at the center of the window with the calculated median value.
Signal Characteristics: Consider the frequency content and variability of your signal. If your signal contains low-frequency baseline variations that you want to smooth out, a larger kernel size may be appropriate. However, 
if the baseline variations are high-frequency or rapid, a smaller kernel size might be sufficient.

#kernel size >> 101: signal to subtract was a straight line (maybe there is no neighbour window?)
# so there was no change to the baseline
#small kernel size just made the line worse
#but test this again later to see the exact effects
